# World-energy-production-and-consumption-analysis

## Project overview
This project focuses on the energy production and consumption patterns across Europe for the year 2000 - 2020. The main goal of this study is to explore which countries in Europe are energy producers and which are energy consumers. It evaluates the balance between energy production and consumption across different countries to highlight energy surpluses (indicating export potential) and energy deficits (indicating dependency on imports). Additionally, the project includes per capita energy analysis to provide insights into energy efficiency and sustainability relative to population size.

## Objectives
- To identify the major energy producers and consumers in Europe in 2020.
- To examine the energy balance (deficit or surplus) of countries, highlighting which countries rely on imports and which are exporters.
- To assess per capita energy production and consumption, providing insights into energy efficiency and consumption patterns relative to population.
- To visualize the types of energy sources used (e.g., coal, crude oil, natural gas, refined products) and compare their distribution across countries.
- To understand the relationship between energy production, consumption, and CO2 emissions, with insights on energy intensity related to GDP.

## Datasets
Europe Energy Production and Consumption Dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shub218/energy-data-1990-2020: Contains data on energy production and consumption across European countries for 2020, broken down by energy type (coal, crude oil, natural gas, refined products).

## Analysis
Energy Production and Consumption Overview:
A bar chart compares total energy production versus consumption for each country, highlighting countries with energy surpluses (e.g., Russia, Norway) and deficits (e.g., Germany, France).
A bar chart visualizing energy deficit/profit shows countries like Norway and Russia producing far more than they consume, whereas others like Germany and Italy face significant energy deficits.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights significant disparities in energy production and consumption across European countries, with some acting as major energy exporters while others rely heavily on imports. This has implications for energy policy, particularly in terms of sustainability and energy independence. The per capita analysis shows that smaller energy-rich countries tend to produce more energy per person, while larger industrial nations must import significant quantities to meet demand.
